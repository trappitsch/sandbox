# Slint - Tokio crossover example

This is a sandbox example to demonstrate how to use Slint and spawn Tokio tasks. 
Two things are demonstrated:

- Spawning an endless tokio task that updates a counter (in the negative direction)
- Starting and stopping an endless tokio task increments the same counter. The start and stop are done from the Slint UI with buttons.

It's an example, do with it what you want :)
